            Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language.
            It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under
            the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming
            language.
